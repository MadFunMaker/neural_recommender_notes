## Overview of Music Recommender System

#### My Own Category
- All user's usage to music recommendation (CF)
- One user's usage pattern (Genre or Artist) to music recommendation
- User's emotion to music recommendation 
  
**Here, I focus on the third one, user's emotion to music recommendation**

#### User's emotion to music recommendation 
- Recommend music appropriate for user's current emotion.

- Disadvantage
