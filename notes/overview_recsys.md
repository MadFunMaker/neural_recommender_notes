## Overview of Recommender System (RS)

#### Category
- Collaborative Filtering (CF)
  - Memory-based CF (= neighborhood method)
    - Item oriented approach
    - User oriented approach
  - Model-based CF (= latent factor model)
- Content-based recommender system
- Miscellaneous recommender systems
  - Demographic information about user
  - Applying the utility function to the items and determine its rank for user.
  - Knowledge-based recommendation
  - Graph-based recommendation
  - Co-occurrence item recommendation
  
**Hybrid methods include more than one of the above methods.**

#### Method Description
- Memory-based CF
  - Think of it simply as a recommendation made based on similarity values. (Pearson correlation, Cosine similarity, etc)
- Model-based CF
  - Recommendation based on machine learning or data mining models. (e.g. Naive Bayesian, Clustering, MF, PMF - the best single model so far)
- Content-based recommender system
  - Use user profiles, item information, reviews (Collaborative topic modeling)
